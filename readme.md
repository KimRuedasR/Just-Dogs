## üìñüêæ Description

Just Dogs is a mobile application dedicated to dog lovers. Inspired by regular social networks, this app is a niche social network where users can share and view photos of dogs. The unique feature of this app is its use of machine learning to recognize and feature only dog pictures, ensuring a focused and delightful experience for canine enthusiasts.

## üõ†Ô∏èüêï Requirements

- React Native
- Expo
- Redux
- Node.js
- Firebase
- Machine Learning API for dog recognition

## üöÄüêæ Setup

### 1. Clone Repo üì•

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KimRuedasR/Just-Dogs.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies üì¶

- Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
cd Just-Dogs/frontend
```

- Then run:

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Firebase Setup üî•

- For Firebase integration, create a `.env` file in your project root/frontend foler and add your Firebase configuration keys in the format `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_key"`, etc.
- In your app, access these keys via `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_FIREBASE_API_KEY` and similar for other Firebase settings.
- Ensure `.env` is added to `.gitignore` to keep your keys secure.

### 4. Start the App with Expo üåü

Run the React project with npm in the "./frontend".

```bash
npm start
```
