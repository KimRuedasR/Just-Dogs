## 📖🐾 Description

Just Dogs is a mobile application dedicated to dog lovers. Inspired by regular social networks, this app is a niche social network where users can share and view photos of dogs. The unique feature of this app is its use of machine learning to recognize and feature only dog pictures, ensuring a focused and delightful experience for canine enthusiasts.

## 🛠️🐕 Requirements

- React Native
- Expo
- Redux
- Node.js
- Firebase
- Machine Learning API for dog recognition

## 🚀🐾 Setup

### 1. Clone Repo 📥

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KimRuedasR/Just-Dogs.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies 📦

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Firebase Setup 🔥

- For Firebase integration, create a `.env` file in your project root and add your Firebase configuration keys in the format `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_key"`, etc.
- In your app, access these keys via `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_FIREBASE_API_KEY` and similar for other Firebase settings.
- Ensure `.env` is added to `.gitignore` to keep your keys secure.

### 4. Start the App with Expo 🌟

Run the React project with npm.

```bash
npm start
```

## 📈🐶 Project Status

The Just Dogs app is currently in its initial development phase. The foundational structure of the React Native project has been established, and key components are being implemented.

- Authentication System: The app now includes basic authentication screens for user registration and login, using Firebase for backend services.
- Firebase Integration: Firebase has been integrated for authentication and data storage.
- Navigation: Basic navigation between the authentication screens has been implemented using React Navigation.
- Redux Integration: Redux is now integrated into the app. This brings a robust state management solution, making the app more scalable and its state predictable.
- Camera Functionality: Users can take and upload pictures within the app.
- Image Posting and Saving: Added the ability to upload images and save them to Firestore storage.
- Profile display: User profile display and layout for image posts.
- UI Development: The user interface for the landing, login, and registration screens is under development.

The project is actively being developed, with upcoming features and enhancements planned to create a comprehensive platform for dog lovers. Contributions and suggestions are welcome to make Just Dogs a delightful experience for its users.
